Description: In order to smoothly animate the transformation of polygons, many
    aspects needs to be taken into account, such as differing number of control
    points, changing center of rotation, etc. The 'transformr' package provides
    an extensive framework for manipulating the shapes of polygons and can be
    seen as the spatial brother to the 'tweenr' package.
